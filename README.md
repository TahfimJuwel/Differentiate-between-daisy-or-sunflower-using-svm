# Differentiate-between-daisy-or-sunflower-using-svm
A classic computer vision project using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of daisies and sunflowers. Built with Scikit-learn and OpenCV, this model uses raw pixel values as features to achieve ~86% test accuracy, demonstrating a fundamental machine learning pipeline.
